# Lake Tahoe Activity Guide
  
## Introduction
Welcome to my first project in Flatiron school program. 
In the end of phase-1 of my curriculum I wanted to make an application about something I love and passionate about. I live close to Lake Tahoe and enjoy everything it has to offer: 
•	beautiful tall mountains,
•	deep blue lake with crystal clear water,
•	restaurants, casinos and live music,
all the outdoor and indoor activities! 

## Let’s get started
1.	If you haven't already, fork and clone this lab into your local environment. Navigate into its directory in the terminal, then run code . to open the files in Visual Studio Code.
2.	Run npm install to install the lab's dependencies.
3.	Run json-server --watch db.json to start the server.
4.	Open index.html in the browser and take a look at the page.

## overview
My application is showing some of different activities available on lake Tahoe, like Skiing, hiking, paddleboarding, rock climbing, enjoying beaches or restaurants.
User will be able to:
•	sort activities by preferred season, 
•	choose one of the activities from the list provided on top of the page and see detailed description of a chosen activity below, 
•	add comments,
•	like/dislike the activity.

Hope you'll enjoy it and come visit "Big Blue" Tahoe!
